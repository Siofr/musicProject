Repository for Music Project for college, coded in Processing

For this assignment I wanted to create a game in which elements on the screen reacted to music, I begand by wanting to create a top down shooter although eventually decided that a simple game where the player must race against a draining health bar to pick up objects that restore their health would be better.

I added a score system and a music selection screen.
